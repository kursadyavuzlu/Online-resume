<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I graduated from the Computer and Software Engineering Department of Toros University in 2020. Due to the onset of the pandemic and some family circumstances, I took a break from my job search for a while. As of September 2022, after completing my military service, I am looking for a job in order to return to my sector and gain experience. I am particularly interested in web and mobile application development, I have basic knowledge of C# and Python languages.</p>
